# Covid_Tracker
This is an universitary project that i have develop in C, using socket Programming.
With this program is possible to store informantion about the results of the Covid-test from more nodes, then all the information is not merged in a sigle point, but every node can search results mantained by others nodes. I have used an hybrid architecture p2p/client-server to manage the relationships between differnt processes. More details in the documentation.

The documentation is in italian if you need help to translate contact me.
